# at-pytorch-template
Basic template for pytorch projects with logging.
To use, modify the programs in the mains folder.
Add configs as necessary to reuse the same scripts but with different parameters.

## Running/Testing
To run or test, use commands similar to the test.sh script that will train 1 model with 2 sets of configs. Note that all scripts should be run from the top directory to make sure that the python importing works correctly
